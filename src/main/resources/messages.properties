#ABOUT PAGE
about.title=About
about.subtitle=What's the point of this web application?
about.text=When starting out, learning about machine learling can be incredibly \
challenging. Being able to interpretate the results of creating \
a model requires significant knowledge about algorithms, algorithm \
parameters and mathematics. Besides that, the resources that are \
available during this steep learning curve aren't very beginner friendly. \
The weka software, however powerfull, is hard to use as a beginner \
due to it's unintuitive design and lack of information.<br> \
<br> \
To alleviate this beginners burden, we have made this web \
application to provide an easy workflow combined with easy \
access to information that is required to interpretate the \
results of your models and analysis.

information.title=Machine Learning
information.subtitle=Merriam Webster defines machine learning as follows:<br>\
<i>"The term machine learning (abbreviated ML) refers to the \
capability of a machine to improve its own performance. \
It does so by using a statistical model to make decisions \
and incorporating the result of each new trial into that \
model. In essence, the machine is programmed to learn \
through trial and error."</i><br>
ZeroR.information=The simplest of the rule based classifiers is the majority class classifier, called 0-R or\
ZeroR in Weka. The 0-R (zero rule) classifier takes a look at the target attribute and its possible\
values. It will always output the value that is most commonly found for the target attribute in the\
given dataset. 0-R as its names suggests; it does not include any rule that works on the non target\
attributes. So more specifically it predicts the mean (for a numeric type target attribute) or the mode\
(for a nominal type attribute).
ZeroR.information.example = Example :"Play Golf = Yes" is the ZeroR model for the dataset with an accuracy of 0.64 is 9 yes and 5 no .
ZeroR.information.modelEvaluation = ZeroR only predicts the majority class correctly. As mentioned before, \
ZeroR is only useful for determining a baseline performance for other classification methods.
OneR.information=OneR, short for "One Rule", is a simple, yet accurate, classification algorithm that generates one rule \
  for each predictor in the data, then selects the rule with the smallest total error as its "one rule".  \
  To create a rule for a predictor, we construct a frequency table for each predictor against the target. \
  It has been shown that OneR produces rules only slightly less accurate than state-of-the-art classification algorithms \
  while producing rules that are simple for humans to interpret.\
  For each predictor,\
  For each value of that predictor, make a rule as follows;  \
1: Count how often each value of target (class) appears.  \
2: Find the most frequent class.   \
3: Make the rule assign that class to this value of the predictor.  \
4: Calculate the total error of the rules of each predictor.  \
5: Choose the predictor with the smallest total error.
OneR.information.example=  Example: Finding the best predictor with the smallest total error using OneR algorithm based on related frequency tables. 
OneR.information.modelEvaluation = Simply, the total error calculated from the frequency tables is the measure of \
  each predictor contribution. A low total error means a higher contribution to the predictability of the model.  
NaiveBayes.information=The Naive Bayesian classifier is based on Bayes’ theorem with the \
  independence assumptions between predictors. A Naive Bayesian model is easy to build, with no complicated \
  iterative parameter estimation which makes it particularly useful for very large datasets. Despite its simplicity, \
  the Naive Bayesian classifier often does surprisingly well and is widely used because it often outperforms more sophisticated \
  classification methods. Bayes theorem provides a way of calculating the posterior probability, \
  P(c|x), from P(c), P(x), and P(x|c). Naive Bayes classifier assume that the effect of the value of a predictor (x) \
  on a given class (c) is independent \
  of the values of other predictors. This assumption is called class conditional independence.
NaiveBayes.information.example = In ZeroR model there is no predictor, in OneR model we try to find the single best predictor, naive Bayesian includes all predictors using Bayes' rule and the independence assumptions between predictors.
NaiveBayes.information.modelEvaluation = The posterior probability can be calculated by first, \
  constructing a frequency table for each attribute against the target. \
  Then, transforming the frequency tables to likelihood tables and finally use the Naive Bayesian \
  equation to calculate the posterior probability for each class. \
  The class with the highest posterior probability is the outcome of prediction. 
IBK.information=K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). \
  In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric classification\
  \ method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification \
  and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in data set. The output depends on whether k-NN is\
  \ used for classification or regression:\
In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors,\
  \ with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). \
  A case is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the case being assigned to the class most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function. \
  If K = 1, then the case is simply assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor. 	
IBK.information.example=It should also be noted that all three distance measures are only valid for continuous variables. \
  In the instance of categorical variables the Hamming distance must be used. It also brings up the issue of standardization of \
  the numerical variables between 0 and 1 when there is a mixture of numerical and categorical variables in the dataset. \
  Choosing the optimal value for K is best done by first inspecting the data. In general,\
  a large K value is more precise as it reduces the overall noise but there is no guarantee. \
  Cross-validation is another way to retrospectively determine a good K value by using an independent dataset to validate the K value. \
  Historically, the optimal K for most datasets has been between 3-10. That produces much better results than 1NN.
IBK.information.modelEvaluation= One major drawback in calculating distance measures directly from the training set is in the case where variables have different \
  measurement scales or there is a mixture of numerical and categorical variables. \
  For example, if one variable is based on annual income in dollars, and the other is based on age \
  in years then income will have a much higher influence on the distance calculated. One solution is to standardize the training set as shown below.
J48.information=J4.8 is Weka implementation of decision tree algorithm C4.5. It is actually built upon ID3\
algorithm by adding features like pruning as well as allowing numeric attribute values.\
C4.5 is an algorithm used to generate a decision tree developed by Ross Quinlan. \
  C4.5 is an extension of Quinlan's earlier ID3 algorithm. The decision trees generated by C4.5 can be used for \
  classification, and for this reason, C4.5 is often referred to as a statistical classifier. \
  In 2011, authors of the Weka machine learning software described the C4.5 algorithm as "a landmark decision tree program \
  that is probably the machine learning workhorse most widely used in practice to date. Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. \
  It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller \
  subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. \
  The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy). \
  Leaf node (e.g., Play) represents a classification or decision. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. \
  Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
J48.information.example = The core algorithm for building decision trees called ID3 by J. R. Quinlan which employs a top-down, \
  greedy search through the space of possible branches with no backtracking. ID3 uses Entropy and Information Gain to construct a \
  decision tree. In ZeroR model there is no predictor, in OneR model we try to find the single best predictor, naive Bayesian includes \
  all predictors using Bayes' rule and the independence assumptions between predictors but decision tree includes all predictors with the\
  \ dependence assumptions between predictors.
J48.information.modelEvaluation = A decision tree is built top-down from a root node and involves partitioning the data into subsets that contain instances with similar values (homogenous). ID3 algorithm uses entropy to calculate the homogeneity of a sample. \
  If the sample is completely homogeneous the entropy is zero and if the sample is an equally divided it has entropy of one.
