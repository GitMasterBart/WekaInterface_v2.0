#ALGORITHM INFORMATION PAGE
information.title=Weka Algortihms

ZeroR.information=The simplest of the rule based classifiers is the majority class classifier, called 0-R or\
ZeroR in Weka. The 0-R (zero rule) classifier takes a look at the target attribute and its possible\
values. It will always output the value that is most commonly found for the target attribute in the\
given dataset. 0-R as its names suggests; it does not include any rule that works on the non target\
attributes. So more specifically it predicts the mean (for a numeric type target attribute) or the mode\
(for a nominal type attribute).
OneR.information=This is also another simple rule based classifier. In this case only one rule is applied to the\
dataset, hence called 1R or OneR in Weka. The classifier will select one attribute and find the best\
classification rule based on it. Using the value of this attribute for a given instance, the rule will\
then predict the value of the target attribute. In other words, it uses the minimum-error attribute for\
prediction and discretizing numeric attributes. For more information see:\
R.C. Holte (1993). Very simple classification rules perform well on most commonly used datasets.
NaiveBayes.information=In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve higher accuracy levels. Naïve Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.
IBK.information=In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric classification method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in data set. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\
\
In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
J48.information=J4.8 is Weka implementation of decision tree algorithm C4.5. It is actually built upon ID3\
algorithm by adding features like pruning as well as allowing numeric attribute values.\
C4.5 is an algorithm used to generate a decision tree developed by Ross Quinlan. C4.5 is an extension of Quinlan's earlier ID3 algorithm. The decision trees generated by C4.5 can be used for classification, and for this reason, C4.5 is often referred to as a statistical classifier. In 2011, authors of the Weka machine learning software described the C4.5 algorithm as "a landmark decision tree program that is probably the machine learning workhorse most widely used in practice to date"
